### Hello!

#### Currently working on: 
- (mostly UI) automation with the [Ansible AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) project.
- Teaching myself drawing. I'm following the surprisingly mechanical process at [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/). It's been interesting to learn that drawing can improve in a mechanical manner with training, much in the same way a person's muscle coordination and technique improves with something like strength training.

#### Likes: 
- Language learning
- Old hardware
- (Some) new hardware
- Drawing
- Writing scripts for everything so I can type less
- Using parentheses (a lot)

#### Dislikes:
- Uncooked celery (I'm allergic)
